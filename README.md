# JVMs Compare
## JVM comparisons - using benchmarks

This repository hosts a few unit tests run as a maven project with different profiles.

The unit tests rely on [**Eclipse Collections**](https://eclipse.org/collections) library and use JMH for benchmarks.

Various profiles are intended to execute the same benchmarks on different JVMs, such as GraalVM CE, GraalVM EE, OpenJDK 8, Oracle JDK 8.
